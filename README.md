# StarMan

Starman will take the player through the journey of Star. Star’s routine takes an unexpected turn as he winds up in a city that’s nothing similar to like his on earth. There is no clear path home except for the cultural myth, Man, who can grant any wish to anyone who is willing to bring her three things. Star must solve puzzles and uncover the history of this mysterious world to find the items necessary to complete Man’s quest in order to earn his wish home.

## Design Brief

This project will consist of an introductory level game produced in GB Studios. Its aesthetics will follow that of a retro adventure game. There will be task related puzzles that are needed to be solved in order to progress in the game’s story lines. This game’s target audience will be towards people who play games for an enjoyment of interactivity and puzzles.
The name of the game will be Starman.
The player will be able to navigate the maps by moving north, south, east, and west. The player will also be able to interact with many NPCs that all have their own personalities. The puzzles will incorporate other actions, such as pulling and pushing items, picking up essential items, and using said items.
